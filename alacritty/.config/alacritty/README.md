> Alacritty is being used because the tab feature of other terminals is not required as you would be using tmux and alacritty is also very fast.

## Step 1: Install Alacritty

```bash
yay -S alacritty
```

## Step 2: Stow this directory

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow alacritty
```

Now you can simply open alacritty and use it.
